/**
  * Contains list of available and removed DeprecatedFeatures.
  *
  * We do not want to delete a hard-removed deprecated feature until one full minor version after the hard removal
  * date. For example, if a deprecated feature is hard-removed in 1.8.0, then:
  *
  *   - 1.8.0: The associated code for the deprecated feature is removed
  *   - 1.9.0: The deprecated flag is removed.
  *
  * This way, if they upgrade to 1.8.0, we can show the operator a nice error message in the logs telling them that the
  * specific deprecated feature they tried to enable is permanently removed, with a recommendation for how to proceed,
  * as opposed to simply telling them it is an unknown deprecated feature.
