# Metrics

Marathon uses [Dropwizard Metrics](https://github.com/dropwizard/metrics)
for its metrics. You can query the current metric values via the
`/metrics` HTTP endpoint.

For the specific syntax see the
[metrics command-line flags]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/command-line-flags.html#metrics-flags)
section.

## Stability of metric names

Although we try to prevent unnecessary disruptions, we do not provide
stability guarantees for metric names between major and minor releases.

## Metric types

Marathon has the following metric types:

* a `counter` is a monotonically increasing integer, for instance, the
  number of Mesos `revive` calls performed since Marathon became
  a leader.
* a `gauge` is a current measurement, for instance, the number of apps
  currently known to Marathon.
* a `histogram` is a distribution of values in a stream of measurements,
  for instance, the number of apps in group deployments.
* a `meter` measures the rate at which a set of events occur.
* a `timer` is a combination of a meter and a histogram, which measure
  the duration of events and the rate of their occurrence.

Histograms and timers are backed with reservoirs leveraging
[HdrHistogram](http://hdrhistogram.org/).

## Units of measurement

A metric measures something either in abstract quantities, or in the
following units:

* `bytes`
* `seconds`

## Metric names

All metric names are prefixed with `marathon` by default. The prefix can
be changed using `--metrics_name_prefix` command-line flag.

Metric name components are joined with dots. Components may have dashes
in them.

A metric type and a unit of measurement (if any) are appended to
a metric name. A couple of examples:

* `marathon.apps.active.gauge`
* `marathon.http.event-streams.responses.size.counter.bytes`

## Prometheus reporter

The Prometheus reporter is enabled by default, and it can be disabled
with `--disable_metrics_prometheus` command-line flag. Metrics in the
Prometheus format are available at `/metrics/prometheus`.

Dots and dashes in metric names are replaced with underscores.

## StatsD reporter

The StatsD reporter can be enabled with `--metrics_statsd` command-line
flag. It sends metrics over UDP to the host and port specified with
`--metrics_statsd_host` and `--metrics_statsd_port` respectively.

Counters are forwarded as gauges.

## DataDog reporter

The DataDog reporter can be enabled with `--metrics_datadog`
command-line flag. It sends metrics over UDP to the host and port
specified with `--metrics_datadog_host` and `--metrics_datadog_port`
respectively.

Marathon can send metrics to a DataDog agent over UDP, or directly to
the DataDog cloud over HTTP. It is specified using
`--metrics_datadog_protocol`. Its possible values are `udp` (default)
and `api`. If `api` is chosen, your DataDog API key can be supplied with
`--metrics_datadog_api_key`.

Dashes in metric names are replaced with underscores. Counters are
forwarded as gauges.

## Important metrics

* `marathon.apps.active.gauge` — the number of active apps.
* `marathon.deployments.active.gauge` — the number of active
  deployments.
* `marathon.deployments.counter` — the count of deployments received
  since the current Marathon instance became a leader.

  dismissed since the current Marathon instance became a leader;
  a deployment might be dismissed by Marathon, when there are too many
  concurrent deployments.

* `marathon.instances.running.gauge` — the number of running instances
  at the moment.
* `marathon.instances.staged.gauge` — the number of instances staged at
  the moment.
* `marathon.leadership.duration.gauge.seconds` — the duration of
  current leadership.

  status updates received per each task state (`task-running`,
  `task-failed` and so on).
* `marathon.mesos.task.oom.memory-limit-unfulfillable` - The count of
  tasks OOM-killed because, while the container stayed within its
  specified memory limit, the agent was too memory constrained to
  support it.
* `marathon.mesos.task.oom.memory-limit-exceeded` - The count of tasks
  OOM-killed because it exceeded the specified memory limit (or,

## Alerting

Let's consider a few examples of alerting rules. We will use Prometheus
as our alerting tool, but please keep in mind that any alerting service
of your choice can be used instead.

Please note that particular threshold values are dependent on many
variables like the number of applications, a cluster size and so on.

For the syntax of Prometheus alerting rules please refer to
[its official documentation](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/alerting_rules/).

Alert whenever a Marathon instance goes down or restarts:

```yaml
  - alert: Marathon Uptime
    expr: up{job="marathon"} == 0
    for: 30s
    labels:
      severity: warning
    annotations:
      summary: It fires when a Marathon instance stops or restarts.
```

Alert when there are less than 2 out of 3 Marathon instances that are
up and running:

```yaml
  - alert: Marathon Too Few Instances
    expr: sum(up{job="marathon"}) < 2
    for: 30s
    labels:
      severity: critical
      annotations:
      summary: It fires when there are fewer Marathon instances up and running than expected (< 2 instances).
```

Alert if Marathon's heap usage is too high:

```yaml
  - alert: Marathon Heap Usage
    expr: avg_over_time(marathon_jvm_memory_heap_used_gauge_bytes[10s]) > (2 * 1024 * 1024 * 1024)
    for: 10s
    labels:
      severity: critical
    annotations:
      summary: It fires when Marathon's heap is too big (> 2GB).
```

Alert if Marathon has too many threads:

```yaml
  - alert: Marathon Threads
    expr: avg_over_time(marathon_jvm_threads_active_gauge[10s]) > 100
    for: 10s
    labels:
      severity: critical
    annotations:
      summary: It fires when Marathon has too many threads (> 100 threads).
```

Alert if Marathon dismisses deployments way too often:

```yaml
  - alert: Marathon Dismissed Deployments
    expr: rate(marathon_deployments_dismissed_counter[1m]) > 3
    for: 1m
    labels:
      severity: warning
    annotations:
      summary: It fires if there are too many deployments dismissed by Marathon (> 3 deployments over the last minute).
```

Alert if Marathon receives offers, but is unable to use them for some
reason, i.e. insufficient resources:

```yaml
  - alert: Marathon Given No Suitable Offer
    expr: rate(marathon_mesos_offers_used_counter[10m]) == 0 and rate(marathon_mesos_offers_incoming_counter[10m]) > 0
    for: 10m
    labels:
      severity: warning
    annotations:
      summary: It fires if there are incoming Mesos offers, but none can be used by Marathon (for the last 10 minutes).
```

Alert if there are too many concurrent HTTP requests to Marathon:

```yaml
  - alert: Marathon HTTP Requests
    expr: avg_over_time(marathon_http_requests_active_gauge[10s]) > 100
    for: 10s
    labels:
      severity: critical
    annotations:
      summary: It fires if there are too many concurrent HTTP requests to Marathon (> 100 concurrent connections).
```

Alert if Marathon responds with a 5xx status code:

```yaml
  - alert: Marathon HTTP 5xx Responses
    expr: marathon_http_responses_5xx_rate_m1_rate_meter > 0
    for: 10s
    labels:
      severity: critical
    annotations:
      summary: It fires if Marathon responds with a 5xx status codes.
```

Alert if Marathon has too many staged instances, which might indicate
that Marathon does not receive offers with enough resources or

```yaml
  - alert: Marathon Too Many Staged Instances
    expr: marathon_instances_staged_gauge > 10
    for: 10s
    labels:
      severity: warning
    annotations:
      summary: It fires if Marathon has too many staged instances (> 10 staged instances).
```
