# This folder is work in progress

In an [ongoing initiative](https://jira.mesosphere.com/browse/MARATHON-8518), we are working on a complete overhaul of the Marathon documentation. Articles in this folder will not be published until we have covered the majority of concepts.

For now, these articles should simply reference each other directly, with relative links to markdown files. This way, we can navigate in GitHub preview mode without the need to generate static html.

An example for a documentation article is the one on [Instances](instances.md). See the [index](index.md) for all planned articles.
